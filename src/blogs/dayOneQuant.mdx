# My First Blog Post

This is an example blog post written in MDX. You can use all the power of Markdown here, plus React components!

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to write content in Markdown while embedding React components. This makes it perfect for technical blogs.

### Key Benefits

- **Markdown simplicity** - Write content naturally
- **React power** - Embed interactive components
- **Easy to maintain** - Just create `.mdx` files

## Getting Started

Simply create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/blogs` folder with the same structure as this one. Export a `meta` object with:

- `title` - The blog post title
- `date` - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `readTime` - Estimated reading time
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier (should match filename)
- `category` - Category for grouping (e.g., "tech", "fashion", "life")
- `featured` - Set to `true` to show on homepage (max 3 shown)

That's it! Your post will automatically appear in the blogs section.
